## Philosophy

  Trig is heavily inspired by Ruby on Rails. Contrary to backbone.js, Trig is a highly opinionated framework for angular.js developers
  looking for a well defined starting point for their applications. Trig is the cure for [analysis paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis). 
  Setting up a well thought out structure for an angular.js applications with all testing, building, deployment, and processing tasks accounted for 
  can be daunting. Trig takes care of these details for you and allows you to concentrate on building your app immediately.
